Assumptions and Design Decisions

InMemory Database:

This is suitable for development and testing but should be replaced with a persistent database for production.

No Authentication/Authorization:

These would be necessary for a production-ready API.

Basic CRUD Operations:

Implemented basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for the Customer model.

Default Validation:

Minimal validation is implemented, assuming inputs are generally correct. In a full implementation, more robust validation and error handling would be necessary.

Tools and Technologies Used

NET Core 6: For building the Web API.
Entity Framework Core: For data access and InMemory database.
NUnit: For writing and running unit tests.
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing: For integration testing of the API.
Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code: IDE for development.

Potential Improvements

Authentication and Authorization:

Implement JWT or OAuth-based authentication to secure the API.

Add role-based authorization to restrict access to certain endpoints.

Persistent Database:

Replace the InMemory database with a persistent database like SQL Server, PostgreSQL, or MySQL.

Implement database migrations and seed data for easier deployment and testing.
Advanced Validation and Error Handling:

Use libraries for more comprehensive validation.
Implement global exception handling to provide consistent error responses.

Pagination and Filtering:

Add pagination, sorting, and filtering capabilities to the GET endpoints to handle large datasets efficiently.

DTOs and AutoMapper:

Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to decouple the API layer from the data layer.
Use AutoMapper to map between entities and DTOs.

CI/CD Pipeline:

Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate testing and deployment.

Logging and Monitoring:

Implement logging using Serilog or NLog.
Set up monitoring and alerting for the API using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

Testing Strategies:

Expand test coverage to include more edge cases and integration tests.
Consider using Mock frameworks like Moq to isolate unit tests further.
